# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

    # materialized: view

# This corresponds to the name specified in your dbt profile.yml file for the PostgreSQL destination
